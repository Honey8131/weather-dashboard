## Learning Points
Throughout this project, I learned a lot about working with APIs and JavaScript. At first, I struggled with understanding how the API worked and how to properly format the requests to retrieve weather data. However, with some trial and error and research, I was able to get it working properly.

Another area where I struggled was with debugging errors in my code. I had to spend a lot of time going through my code line by line to identify where I had made mistakes and figure out how to fix them. Through this process, I learned the importance of using console.log and other debugging tools to help me find errors more quickly.

Overall, I feel like I learned a lot from this project and gained valuable experience in working with APIs and debugging code. I know that these skills will be useful for future projects and I'm excited to continue learning and improving my abilities as a developer.
